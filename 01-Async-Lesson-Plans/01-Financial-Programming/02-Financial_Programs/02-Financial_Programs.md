# Lesson 2: Financial Programs

## Set Up Your Financial Programming Tools

Much of the software in the fintech world is written in the Python coding language. To start coding in Python, you need to set up and familiarize yourself with the various tools you'll use, like the terminal. You should also check that your code is in the right folder or subfolder.

This lesson will give you experience in common software development setup. In particular, you'll write a Python program in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and then execute that program.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to create Python programs and run them using the terminal. Let’s begin by exploring the command-line interface (CLI), using Terminal or Git Bash.

## Use Terminal and Git Bash

The videos in this lesson will provide the following information:

* How to use Terminal (macOS) and Git Bash (Windows)

* Commands you should know in order to navigate your folder structure from the command line

* How to create a `FinTech_Workspace` folder from the command line

### Terminal (macOS)

For macOS users, the following video demonstrates how to use Terminal:

### Git Bash (Windows)

For Windows users, the following video demonstrates how to use Git Bash:

## Set Up a Python Project Folder

Now that you can navigate the CLI, you’ll need to set up a folder and Python file. Once you’ve completed these two steps, you’ll be able to write Python code.

We'll use VS Code to create a `Python_Project` folder and a file named `hello_python.py`, which we'll save in the folder.

The following video walks you through the steps:

## Write a Python Program

You’ve completed all the necessary setup, so now you can begin writing some actual Python code!

Before starting this next step, open VS Code on your computer so that you can follow along. We'll use VS Code to write a Python program, as demonstrated in the following video:

## Run a Python Program

Okay, so you’ve written your first Python program—now it's time to run it. You'll run the program from either Terminal (macOS) or Git Bash (Windows).

### Run a Python Program with Terminal (macOS)

For macOS users, the following video explains how to run the program from Terminal:

### Run a Python Program with Git Bash (Windows)

For Windows users, the following video explains how to run the program from Git Bash:

Awesome! Take the following assessment for a quick check of what you've learned so far:

## Install the Code Command in PATH (macOS)

Nice work keeping up with all of these new processes!

This last step is for macOS users only. We'll update VS Code by installing the `code` command in `PATH`. This will allow files and folders to open directly from your Terminal application in VS Code. Windows users will already have `code` available in Git Bash.

The following video walks you through the necessary steps:

Congratulations! You’re all set up and ready to start coding. In the next lesson, you’ll have the opportunity to run code on your own from the terminal, as well as create Python files. If you ever get stuck, come back to this lesson and review the videos for a refresher.
